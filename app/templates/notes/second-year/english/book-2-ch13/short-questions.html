<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>1.</span>  What are antiseptics and what is the antiseptic method?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Antiseptics are chemicals used to kill germs like carbolic acid and iodine. The purpose of the method is to prevent germs from getting into the body.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>2.</span> What was the chief defect of antiseptic method?<div class="center">OR</div>Why was the use of Carbolic acid abandoned?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Injecting Carbolic acid was abandoned because it destroyed Leucocytes, the natural armour of human body against disease, along with germs. To kill all the germs the dose would have had to be strong enough to kill the patient too.</h4>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>3.</span> What part is played by the white cells in the blood of a human body?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Leucocytes are the natural armour of the body against a disease. It was Metchnikoff, a Russian bacteriologist, who discovered the Leucocytes. He shoed when germs enter the body, they are immediately attacked by white cells form the whole neighbourhood.</h4>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>4.</span> Give an account of the early life of Fleming.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Sir Alexander Fleming was born on a farm near Darvel, in Ayrshire, in 1881. He was the youngest of a family of eight.

At fourteen, he went to London to study at the Regent Street Polytechnic.</h4>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>5.</span> Describe how Fleming discovered penicillin.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Fleming was carrying out a series of experiments on staphylococcus in his laboratory at St. Mary's. As Fleming uncovered his culture plate to examine the germs, a mould spore dropped on the plate. Having settled on the plate, the mould began to grow, and almost at once the microbes round it began to disappear. Fleming got interested in it and tested its effects. Fleming named this mould spore penicillin.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>6.</span> In what respect is penicillin better than the chemical antiseptics?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Penicillin was three times as strong as Carbolic acid. What was more important was that, unlike carbolic acid and all the other chemical antiseptics, it had no harmful effect at all on Leucocytes.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>7.</span> What do you know of the Oxford team?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">The Oxford team included trained chemists as well as bacteriologists, and had all the equipment that Fleming had lacked; yet it was a long, hard struggle before they produced a practical concentration of penicillin.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>8.</span> How did they make penicillin more effective?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">In its crude form, Penicillin could not be used for treatment of disease. The Oxford team consisting of trained chemists and bacteriologists, after hard struggle, succeeded in producing a practical concentration of penicillin. Now, humans could be treated with penicillin.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>9.</span> Write a note on penicillin as a wonder drug.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Penicillin was welcomed as a wonder drug because it revolutionized the healing of war wounds. It saved countless lives and thus proved to be the strongest weapon ever made in the fight against disease.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>10.</span> Was Fleming proud of his discovery?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Fleming was not proud of his discovery of penicillin. When people thanked him for saving their lives, he always said that nature made penicillin, and he just found it. He insisted that he had discovered penicillin by chance.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>11.</span> Why couldn't penicillin have been discovered in the research laboratories of America?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Laboratories in Detroit were gleaming, dustless, air-conditioned, and sterilized. There culture plates were never contaminated. Fleming shocked the Americans by saying that penicillin could never have been discovered in their labs because there was no way in for a mould spore.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>12.</span> Fleming's achievement paved the way for other discoveries in the medical field. What are they?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Fleming's achievement was not only the discovery of penicillin, he opened up a new world of science. He provoked others to seek new antibiotics, particularly in moulds and fungi, and the researchers discovered new drugs, such as streptomycin which is the best known at present.</h4>
