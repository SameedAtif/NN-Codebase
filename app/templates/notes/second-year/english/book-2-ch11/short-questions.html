	<h3 class="statement"><span>1.</span> The writer says that the examiners ask questions which students cannot answer and not those which they can answer. Is this complaint just?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">As far as Churchill is concerned, his complaint is just. In his case, the examiners almost invariably asked the questions to which he was unable to suggest a satisfactory answer. Through those questions, the examiners tried to expose his ignorance.</h4>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>2.</span> What sort of questions are asked by you examiners?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">The questions asked by out examiners are usually those which we cannot answer. The examiners almost everywhere in the world try to ask students such questions as may expose students' ignorance. They do not ask what the students know, but ask them what they do not know.</h4>

<div class="question important">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>4.</span> How did Churchill do his Latin paper?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Churchill performed very badly in his entrance examination to Harrow. He could not answer a single question in the Latin paper. He wrote his name at the top of page, and then the question number 'I'. Later he put a bracket around it as '(I)'. But he could not think of anything relevant to the answer.</h4>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>5.</span> Churchill was taught English at Harrow and not Latin and Greek. Was it a gain or loss?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Churchill benefited a lot from his long stay at Harrow. His school-fellows who studied Latin and Greek had to learn English to earn their living.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>6.</span> What good did his three years at Harrow do him?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Churchill learned English thoroughly during his three years at Harrow, which he calls a noble thing. He found the knowledge of English much helpful in his practical life. The knowledge of his national language helped him earn his livelihood and make his way in his life.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>7.</span> In after years how did the knowledge of English stand him in good stead?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">He found the knowledge of English much helpful in his practical life. The knowledge of his national language helped him earn his livelihood and make his way in his life. Thus, Churchill gained much advantage over his school-fellows who learned Latin and Greek.</h4>
</div>

<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>8.</span> Write an appreciation or criticism of Churchill's views in regard to the study of Latin, Greek and English and their value in earning a living.</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">Churchill is absolutely right in saying that national language must be learned first and any foreign language second. If one doesn't have a sufficient knowledge of one's national language, learning a foreign language may not be of any value. Moreover, to earn a living and make way in life, one must have a thorough knowledge of one's national language.</h4>
