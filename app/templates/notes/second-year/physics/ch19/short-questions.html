<div class="question">
	<h3 class="statement"><span>19.2</span> Does the dilation means that time really passes more slowly in moving system or that it only seems to pass more slowly?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">
		<p>Time actually passes more slowly in the moving reference frame. It is not just that it seems this way, it has actually been measured to pass more slowly, as predicted by special relativity. It happens when observers are in relative motion. The result is applied to the timing processes physical, chemical and biological. Even aging process of the human body is slowed down by motion at a very high speed.</p>
		<p>This phenomenon cannot be observed in daily life because we don't move at a speed comparable to the speed of light.</p>

	<h3 class="statement"><span>19.5</span> Since mass is a form of energy, can we conclude that a compressed spring has more mass than the same spring when it is not compressed?</h3>
	<h4 class="answer">From classical point of view, the mass remains same. According to the theory of relativity (E = mc<sup>2</sup>), mass increases because the compressed spring has more potential energy which was given to it by some external source (for compressing). However, this increase in mass is so small that it can be ignored.</h4>

On de-excitation, they emit photons of frequency which lie in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

	<h4 class="answer">The number of photoelectrons emitted from the metal surface is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident light and not on its frequency. The higher frequency light will eject high-energy electrons, while lower frequency light will eject low-energy electrons.
