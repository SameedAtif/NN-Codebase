    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.1</span> Bohr's theory of Hydrogen atom is based upon several assumptions. Do any of these assumptions contradict classical physics?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		The following assumptions of Bohr's theory contradict classical physics:
		<ol type="a">
			<li>An electron revolving in an orbit around a nucleus does not radiate or absorb energy.</li>
			<li>An electron can have only distinct energy states (or levels).</li>
		</ol>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.2</span> What is meant by a line spectrum? Explain how line spectrum can be used for the identification of elements?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>The spectrum of gaseous atoms often contain a number of sharp bright lines of emitted radiation or a number of dark lines on a continuous background due to absorption. Such a spectrum is called a line spectrum. This phenomenon takes place when atoms make transitions between definite energy levels.</p>
		<p>Line spectra can be used to identify elements because different elements have line spectra of different wavelengths.</p>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.3</span> Can the electron in the ground state of Hydrogen absorb a photon of energy 13.6 eV and greater than 13.6 eV?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Since ground state energy of an electron is equal to its ionization energy, so an electron in the ground state of Hydrogen atom can only absorb a photon of energy 13.6 eV (not greater than this), which will ionize it.</h4>

<div class="question important">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.4</span> How can the spectrum of Hydrogen contain so many lines when Hydrogen contains one electron?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">A Hydrogen atom has only one electron but there are infinite number of energy states. The transition of electron between every two of these states gives a new wavelength and, therefore, a new line in the spectrum. As large number of different energy transitions are possible, therefore, a large number of different lines can be emitted.</h4>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.5</span> Is energy conserved when an atom emits a photon of light?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Yes, energy is conserved when an atom emits a photon. This is because the energy absorbed by an atom during its excitation is exactly equal to the new energy emitted during its de-excitation process.</h4>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.6</span> Explain why a glowing gas gives only certain wavelengths of light and why that gas is capable of absorbing the same wavelengths? Give a reason why it is transparent to other wavelengths?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">
		<p>The atoms of a glowing gas emit the radiations of wavelengths (or colours) which lie in its spectrum. It can absorb the same wavelengths because only these wavelengths are suitable for excitation of its atoms.</p>
		<p>The radiations of other wavelengths can not excite atoms of this gas, so it is transparent to other wavelengths.</p>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.7</span> What do we mean when we say that the atom is excited?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">When an atom is excited, it means that its electrons are not in their normal orbits, but may have gone to higher energy levels by absorbing energy from some external source.</h4>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.8</span> Can X-rays be reflected, refracted, diffracted and polarized just like any other waves? Explain.</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">As X-rays are similar in nature to ordinary light (both are electromagnetic radiations/waves), so X-rays can be reflected, refracted, diffracted and polarized like any other wave.</h4>

    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.9</span> What are the advantages of lasers over ordinary light?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Lasers have the following advantages over ordinary light:
		<ol type="1">
			<li>The laser light is intense and phase coherent, so it does not spread as compared to ordinary light.</li>
			<li>The energy of laser can be focussed at a point to get enough heat for welding.</li>
			<li>A laser beam is used as a surgical tool for welding detached retina.</li>
			<li>Laser can induce fusion reaction.</li>

<div class="question">
    <h3 class="statement"><span>20.10</span> Explain why laser action could not occur without population inversion between atomic levels?</h3>
    <h4 class="answer">Population inversion is the process in which electrons are lifted from ground state to a highly excited state by absorbing high energy photons called "exciting photons". Since laser action is a de-excitation process, for which excitation of electrons is required, it can not take place without population inversion.</h4>
